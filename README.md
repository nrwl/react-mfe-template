# Nx React Module Federation Template

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

A production-ready monorepo template for building **Vite-powered React Module Federation** apps with Nx - the fastest
way to split a frontend into independently deployable micro-frontends without giving up a great monorepo developer
experience.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Create a new workspace from this template
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --template nrwl/react-mfe-template

cd my-workspace

# Serve the shell (host) on its own - loads providers at runtime from localhost
npx nx run @react-mfe/shell:dev

# Serve a provider - the shell comes along automatically (dependsOn shell:dev),
# so you can browse http://localhost:4200 and see the provider federated in,
# or hit the provider's own port to see it standalone.
npx nx run @react-mfe/shop:dev
npx nx run @react-mfe/cart:dev

# Or bring up everything at once (the shared shell:dev starts only once)
npx nx run-many -t dev -p shop cart

# Build all apps in parallel for production
npx nx run-many -t build --parallel=3
```

When everything is running:
- Shell (host): http://localhost:4200  (Home / Shop / Cart routes)
- Shop provider standalone: http://localhost:5101
- Cart provider standalone: http://localhost:5102

The `dev` target on each provider declares `dependsOn: ["shell:dev"]`, so
`nx dev shop`, `nx dev cart`, or `nx run-many -t dev -p shop cart` all boot the
shell too - no need to start it in a separate terminal.

## What's Inside

```
apps/
  shell/    - Consumer (host) - TanStack Router app; one route per federated module
  shop/     - Provider (remote) - product catalog with category filter, port 5101
  cart/     - Provider (remote) - order summary with quantities + totals, port 5102
packages/
  ui/       - Shared library (@react-mfe/ui) - theme tokens, sample catalog,
              ProductCard / ProductGrid / StarRating / Badge - imported by every app
```

### Tags

Each project carries module-boundary tags for future `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` lint rules:

| Project | Tags                        |
|---------|----------------------------|
| shell   | scope:shell, type:consumer |
| shop    | scope:shop, type:provider  |
| cart    | scope:cart, type:provider  |
| ui      | scope:shared, type:ui      |

## How Module Federation Works Here

This template uses **Vite + @module-federation/vite** (the `@nx/react:consumer` and `@nx/react:provider` generators,
NOT the deprecated `host`/`remote` generators removed in Nx 24).

### Dynamic federation (no build-time remote list)

The shell does not list remotes at build time. Instead `apps/shell/src/mf.ts` calls `registerRemotes()` at runtime
with each provider's URL. This means:

- Providers can be deployed independently - the shell picks them up from their URL, no rebuild needed.
- Adding a new provider = add one entry to `PROVIDERS` in `mf.ts` and deploy.

### Routing: one page per federated module

The shell is a **TanStack Router** app (`apps/shell/src/router.tsx`, code-based -
no codegen or extra vite plugin). The root route renders the shell chrome
(`Layout.tsx` - nav bar + `<Outlet />`); each child route maps a path to a
federated module's page:

| Route    | Renders                                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `/`      | Home overview with links to each module         |
| `/shop`  | `shop` provider's `App`, lazy-loaded over MF     |
| `/cart`  | `cart` provider's `App`, lazy-loaded over MF     |

Add a provider -> add one entry to `PROVIDERS` in `mf.ts` and one `createRoute`
in `router.tsx`.

### How the shell loads a provider

```
1. Browser loads shell -> index.html
2. shell/src/index.ts boots @module-federation/runtime, calls registerRemotes()
3. The /shop route (pages.tsx) calls lazyProvider('shop', 'App')
4. Runtime fetches http://localhost:5101/remoteEntry.js (ESM)
5. Shared react/react-dom singleton negotiation happens automatically
6. <ShopApp /> renders inside a Suspense + ProviderBoundary
   (boundary catches network errors gracefully)
```

### Federation artifacts emitted per build

| App   | Key output files                  | Role          |
|-------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| shell | `dist/assets/hostInit-*.js`       | Consumer init |
| shop  | `dist/remoteEntry.js`             | Provider entry|
| cart  | `dist/remoteEntry.js`             | Provider entry|

### Shared lib (@react-mfe/ui)

Every app imports from `@react-mfe/ui` (resolved via `vite.resolve.alias` at build time): the providers pull
`ProductCard` / `ProductGrid` / the sample catalog, the shell pulls `Badge`. The lib's `index.ts` also side-effect
imports `theme.css`, so the shared design tokens load in whichever app imports the lib - no per-app stylesheet.
The lib ships its source directly - no separate build step needed since each app bundles it with its chunks.

## Adding More Providers

```sh
# Generate a new provider wired to the shell consumer
npx nx g @nx/react:provider apps/checkout --bundler=vite --consumer=shell --port=5103

# Then add it to the shell's runtime registry in apps/shell/src/mf.ts:
# { alias: 'checkout', name: 'checkout', entry: 'http://localhost:5103/remoteEntry.js' }
```

## Nx Cloud

Connect this workspace to Nx Cloud to get:

- **Remote cache** - task outputs (builds, tests) are cached and shared across every machine and CI agent.
  A build that takes 60 s locally runs in under 2 s after the first hit.
- **Distributed task execution** - Nx Cloud splits `nx run-many` across multiple agents, running tasks in
  parallel across machines rather than sequentially on one.
- **Self-healing CI** - flaky tasks are detected, automatically retried, and flagged so you fix root causes
  instead of rerunning pipelines.

```sh
npx nx connect
```
